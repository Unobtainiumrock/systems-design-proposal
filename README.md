# Overview

What it means to be human is immutable. What changes over time is the social context in which these traits exist. Data drift is innevitable and thus, we must build a dynamical system that is capable of evolving over time to combat data drift, while simultaneously keeping its core features grounded in the human elements.

## Foundational Concepts & Goal Setting (Relates to Background & Overall Task Goal)

- **Core Goal:** Build and preserve data moat.

- **Preservation:** What does preserving the moat mean? Preventing erosion? Is an immutable moat possible? Intuition tells me a data moat will be ever-changing as data drift is a reality.

- **Defining Success:** A secure data moat doesn't automatically guarantee the desired success. Need to define what success looks like. Make it measurable!

- **Context Acquisitons:** Need to get context from clients via provided sources. How can you incentivize clients to share context? Will it be enough to simply provide the product or service in exchange for it, or will there need to be some concrete financial gain (e.g. getting paid for their data sharing).

- **Stakeholder Identification:** Crucial to map out who the entities are. Get the current list of stakeholders (e.g. client, vendors) and conert it into an entity diagram using Mermaid


## Task Question 1: KPIs for "High Quality Content"

- **Central Tension:** "High quality" content (authentic, human) v.s. "Addictive content" (metrics-drive, potentially negative/divisive) seem diametrically opposed. Dig deeper into what makes high quality content v.s. addictive content. I believe there might be a way to strike a balance between the two  by creating healthy addictions that result in mutually beneficial outcomes for both parties.

- **The "Addictive" Driver:** Often thought of as negative/divisive content. These perform well algorithmically by tapping into human tribalism (in groups v.s. out-groups). This makes sense when thought of through the lens of multi-armed bandit algorithms. If you occasionally show divisive content, then it drives users into a state of action in the form of comments. Comments are valuable data generated byusers, but these also double up as signal sending. These signals are what allow people to be "binned" into their respective groups/tribes via an algorithmic interpretation. The multi-armed bandit algorithm also have novelty and discovery mechanisms baked into it which simualtes the hunt and gambling to some extent. I'll need to investigate a re-imagining of the multi-armed bandit algorithm that produces more ideal outcomes for the maximal amount of stakeholders.

- **Proposed "High Quality" Metrics - Novelty:** Novelty/out-of-distribution (or in the tails) content sit at the intersection of human and agent interest. These should be weighted heavily to combat generic, formulaic outputs (think anit-Marvel fatigue). In the bonus there's talk about whether or not what humans are interested in will diverge from agents. This is both `yes` and `no`. They will `not diverge` in that they will both gravitate towards novel content, but they `will diverge` in tersm of what tribes that they gravitate towards. This implies that we'll need a 1-1 mapping between groups and distinct agents. In order for agents to mimic the flow of human online behavior, we'll need to characterize different tribes and then tune the agents to these tribal personas. **The discovery of such tribes can be achieved by using well-known clustering algorithms** The agents we build can then be fine-tuned based on the data corresponding to each groups distribution of post/comments content. Doing this will make agents more compatible with the assumptions made by the multi-armed-bandit algorithm. Scoring a single particular user or agent to measure which tribe they best fit into can be determined by some combination of the clustering algorithms themselves or a simple cosine similarity of a vector embedding.

- **Engagement Mechanism - Randomness/Discovery:** The addictive nature of casinos(random rewards) is relevant. Novelty stimulates discovery, analogous to hunter-gatherer rewards. Multi-armed-bandit algorithms partially address this, but I think it can be dramatically improved upon. some of the ways this can be done is by playing with the frequency at which random novel information comes in, as well as speeding up feedback loop experiences for the end user.

- **Moral Dilemma:** Optimiing for virality/attention (good for business) might mean manipulating primal nature, potentially harming mental health. This ties back into exploring methods in which we can maximize beneficial outcomes or strike some kind of balance between stakeholders. Additionally, challenge the black box idea. It's operating under the assumption that the current algorithms for viral content is the best version available. However, what if the reason that those parameters are such good predictors of success is due to those being how the underlying system is designed? There may exist a healthier and more fulfulling way to do this. After all, it is the system that promotes what content gets pushed to the masses. We need to counterbalance this idea with the fact that corporations have invested massive resources into the behavioral psychology of what makes their products so addictive.

## Task Question 2: The Best Memory Interface

- **Conceptual Interpretation:** Think of a memory interface like something sitting between consciousness and past experiences. It acts as a contract, dictating how communication occurs and what each component can expect from the other.

- **Alignment with Code Interfaces:** This concept strongly aligns with programming inferfaces --defining interaction rules without specifying implementation.

- **Granularity:** At what level should this inferface exist?

    - Between code components (e.g. classes)?
    - Between systems/microservices?
    - Humans as interfaces (e.g, bridging LLMs and PM requirements)?

- **Implementation Options (from original prommpt):**

    - Fine-tuning one model per client (digital clone approach)?
        - I believe this ones isn't feasible, at least in the early stages.

    - Relying on large context windows in advanced transformerss?
        - I'm thinking this can be best handled with a well-engineeered RAG system


## Task Question 3: Viral Content Black Box & Data Shape

- **Need for Novelty Data:** The black box providing viral content/data should likely highlight novelty or out-of-distribution elements with a greater weighting, as this connects both to both avoid generic content and driving engagement. This have overlap with KPI

## Task Question 4: Other Data Sources Needed*

- **Potential Client Data Srouces:** 
    - Slide decks
    - Excel sheets
    - Call transcripts (Zoom, etc.)
    - Existing content(social media posts, blog articles, videos)
    - Acces to other AI assistants used by the client?
    - Client's social/professional connections (potentially modeled visuallly):
        - As a graph
        - As an adjacendy list (if sparse)
        - As a matrix (if dense)
    
- **Data Dynamics:** Explore the concept of a "steady state" for client data -- does their core voice/style stabilize, or is it constantly evolving? Investigate how platforms like character.ai do things, and whether or not they provide tooling that can be integrated or leveraged in our solutions


## Task Question 5: System Design & Endpoints

- **Core Components:**

    - Ingests the right data
    - Transforms it into the right shapes

- **Ingestion Considerations:**

    - **Identification Mechanism:** How do we identify the "right" data? this depeonds on how we measure and characterize data types (potentially linking back to personas/tribes)

    - **Method:** Use web crawlers? Driect API access? File uploads?

- **Transformation Considerations:**

    - **Data Shape:** What does "right shape" mean?
        - Dimensionality (e.g. for vevtor embeddings)?
        - Attributes/Features (metadata, extracted concepts)?
        - Both?

- **Storage & Accessibility:**

    - What is the best way to store the processed data (vector DB, graph DB, relational DB)?

    - What speed of accessibility is needed? Real-time for generation? Bathc processing acceptable for some update?

- **Endpoints (As specified in prompt):**

    - `POST /script` (Payload: transcript -> engaging, authentic video script)
    - `POST /text` (Payload: transcript -> engaging, authentic text post)
    - Need to thin about how the ingested/transformed data informs thse endpoints


## Bonus Thought Exercises

- **Agent v.s. Human Viwership:** 

    - Agents' "interests" will differ from humans', except regarding novelty. Both will be drawn to novelty.

    - Agents will diverge from humans on the deeply human/primal/evolutionary themse (reporduction, resource acquisiton, tribalism) - (Unless agents are specifically tuned to mimic these tribal personas)

    - **Agent Viewership Dominance:** They might dominate? Its hard to say, but I don't think there will be a runaway growth of this. It will be counter-balanced by the decreasing returns on investment. Think predator-prey population dynamics equations, where there's a "carrying capacity". Its not in companies best interest to kill the system.

    - **Future of B2B Content:** Didn't think too deeply on this one.
